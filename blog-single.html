                                    <h4>Australia tests personalized vaccine for childhood brain cancer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                 Australia has launched the world’s first clinical trial using a personalized mRNA vaccine to treat brain cancer in children and adolescents. The trial, known as the PaedNEO-VAX study, is led by the University of Queensland (UQ) in collaboration with the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI). The program will be conducted in eight children’s hospitals across Australia and involves patients with advanced or treatment-resistant brain tumors, including malignant glioma and medulloblastoma.
This vaccine approach is tailored specifically to each patient based on the genetic profile of their tumor. Researchers will perform genome sequencing on each child’s tumor sample to identify unique cancer markers that will serve as therapeutic targets. Once these markers are identified, a personalized vaccine is produced for each patient within approximately eight to ten weeks after enrollment in the trial.
The vaccine works by activating the patient’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The mRNA vaccine stimulates the body to produce T cells capable of distinguishing between healthy cells and tumor cells. Each participant will receive eight injections in the arm, administered every two weeks, followed by a booster shot several months later.
Researchers emphasized that the trial does not use a placebo, as it would be considered unethical for children with such serious conditions. All participants will receive the actual vaccine. The first phase of the trial focuses on evaluating safety and determining the optimal dosage, while later phases will assess effectiveness, including its ability to slow cancer progression and improve life expectancy and quality of life.
The trial is funded by the Australian government, and the personalized vaccines will be manufactured by the biotechnology company Southern RNA in Queensland before being distributed to participating hospitals. Researchers hope that this personalized mRNA vaccine technology will not only extend the survival of children with poor-prognosis brain cancer but also pave the way for new cancer treatment strategies in the future.

                                    <h4>Scientists Discover a Way to Destroy the Most Dangerous Brain Cancer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                 Scientists have reported a new approach that may help treat glioblastoma, the most aggressive and deadly type of brain cancer. Glioblastoma is a grade IV malignant brain tumor known for its rapid growth and very limited treatment options, especially in older patients.
A researcher named Hui Li from the Department of Pathology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine explained that glioblastoma is an extremely destructive disease with few effective therapies available today. Since 2020, his research team has been identifying key oncogenes (cancer-driving genes) that play a crucial role in the development of glioblastoma. These genes represent a potential weak point that could be targeted by new treatment strategies.
Recently, the research team announced a major breakthrough: they discovered a specific molecule capable of blocking the activity of the oncogene they identified. In laboratory experiments involving mice, this molecule successfully destroyed glioblastoma cells without harming healthy brain tissue. This finding is particularly significant because the molecule is able to cross the blood-brain barrier — a major obstacle that prevents many cancer drugs from reaching tumors inside the brain.
The new approach targets a protein that glioblastoma cells rely on to survive, using a small molecule with clear biological activity. Although the early results are promising, researchers emphasized that the discovery is still far from becoming an approved treatment for patients. The molecule must undergo further studies and clinical trials to confirm its safety and effectiveness in humans and to determine the best way to apply it in medical practice.
Researchers also noted that glioblastoma patients urgently need better treatment options, as the standard therapies have not significantly changed in decades and survival rates remain low. Their ultimate goal is to develop a completely new treatment mechanism that directly attacks the core biological vulnerabilities of glioblastoma and offers real hope for more effective therapies in the future. The study has been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

                                    <h4>Epy Kusnandar – His Battle with Brain Cancer Until His Passing</h4>
                                    <p>
                                 Senior Indonesian actor Epy Kusnandar, widely known for his role as Kang Mus in the TV series Preman Pensiun, passed away on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, at the age of 61. The sad news was announced by his wife, Karina Ranau, through a post on her personal Instagram account, stating that her husband had passed away at 2:24 PM WIB at the age of 61.
Before his passing, Epy Kusnandar had a long history of health struggles. In 2010–2011, he was diagnosed with a serious brain tumor. At the time, doctors predicted that he had only about four months left to live due to the severity of his condition. However, Epy managed to get through that critical period after undergoing medical treatment and adopting a healthier lifestyle, eventually returning to work in the entertainment industry for many years afterward.
Throughout his life, Epy demonstrated resilience and determination despite his serious illness. He openly shared his battle with the disease in interviews and public statements.
In addition to fighting a brain tumor, his health was also affected by other conditions, including a mild stroke in 2020, which impacted his vision and overall well-being.
During his lifetime, Epy was known as a dedicated actor who consistently worked on various film and television projects. Together with his wife, he also ran a culinary business. He was remembered for his friendly personality and sense of humor, traits strongly associated with his iconic character Kang Mus.
His body was laid to rest at Harmony Residence 88 Funeral Home on Jalan Pasir, Jagakarsa, South Jakarta, and he was buried at Jeruk Purut Public Cemetery in South Jakarta on December 4, 2025.
Epy’s passing left deep sorrow in Indonesia’s entertainment industry, especially among his friends, colleagues, and fans who followed his career and health journey over the years.

                                    <h4>Experience of an 8 cm Brain Tumor Patient Undergoing Surgery at Mandaya Royal Hospital Puri with Dr. Joy</h4>
                                    <p>
                               A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain that can press on surrounding tissue, disrupt nerve function, and cause symptoms such as persistent headaches, vision problems, nausea, severe vomiting, balance disturbances, and even decreased consciousness.
This real-life case involves a 38-year-old woman from Jakarta who had an approximately 8 cm tumor in the cerebellum (the small brain), compressing almost the entire area. The condition was detected after she experienced severe symptoms, including worsening headaches, unexplained vomiting, and frequent loss of balance while walking. <br>
> Early Symptoms and Diagnosis
Before receiving her diagnosis, the patient suffered from recurring headaches that gradually worsened, requiring painkillers almost every day. Initially, the symptoms seemed mild, such as blurred vision and pain at the back of her head when coughing or laughing, which she had dismissed as fatigue. However, in May 2025, her condition deteriorated significantly, prompting an MRI scan that revealed a tumor measuring approximately 8 × 5 × 5 cm pressing on the brainstem.<br>
> Surgical Procedure by Dr. Joy
The patient was then referred to Dr. dr. Mardjono Tjahjadi, Sp.BS, Subsp. N-Vas, F.N-Onk, PhD, FICS, IFAANS, widely known as Dr. Joy, a leading neurosurgeon at Mandaya Royal Hospital Puri.
The doctor explained that the tumor was located in a high-risk area and could lead to hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain), making emergency surgery necessary. The operation was performed in two stages: first, the placement of a special shunt to drain the accumulated brain fluid, and second, the direct removal of the tumor. With modern neurosurgical technology and the expertise of the medical team, more than 95% of the tumor tissue was successfully removed without serious complications.<br>
> Post-Surgery Condition
After the surgery, the patient showed significant recovery: her vision became clear again, her headaches completely disappeared, and she was able to walk normally after light physiotherapy sessions. A post-operative MRI confirmed that the tumor had been almost entirely removed, with highly satisfactory radiological and clinical results. The patient expressed her gratitude and encouraged others not to be afraid of undergoing surgery when treated by the right medical team.

                                    <p>
                                  Agung Hercules, whose real name was Agung Santoso, passed away due to glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, at the age of 51 at Dharmais Hospital in Jakarta. Glioblastoma is a type of tumor that affects the brain and spinal cord, grows rapidly, and becomes difficult to treat once it turns into cancer. Although the exact cause of glioblastoma is not yet fully understood, the disease can trigger several noticeable symptoms.
People with glioblastoma often experience loss of appetite and frequent vomiting. Vision may become blurred or appear doubled. Persistent headaches are common, and patients can also undergo changes in personality or mood. Additional symptoms include difficulties in speech, muscle weakness, changes in thinking ability, and seizures.
According to Agung’s manager, Peter, Agung went into coma before his passing, although the exact duration was not disclosed. Peter mentioned that Agung’s condition had worsened during the four days before he died, but added that he passed away peacefully.
Plans were made for Agung Hercules to be laid to rest in Bandung after Friday prayers.

                                    <h4>Michael Bolton Shares Recovery After Rare Brain Cancer Surgery</h4>
                                    <p>
                                   72‑year‑old Grammy‑winning singer Michael Bolton has opened up about his recovery after undergoing surgery for glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. He was diagnosed with the condition in December 2023 and underwent emergency surgery, during which doctors were able to remove the entire tumor.
Bolton first shared his health news with fans on Instagram in January 2024, announcing that he had undergone brain surgery and was taking a break from touring. Since then, he has been living at his home in Westport, Connecticut, where he has spent most of his time with his daughters and six grandchildren, engaging in family activities like playing guessing games together.
Reflecting on his journey, Bolton emphasized the importance of not facing such challenges alone. His daughter Taryn shared that the diagnosis followed a series of unusual events, including Bolton experiencing severe headaches and an unexpected fall from his chair. Shortly afterward, an MRI at the hospital confirmed the presence of a brain tumor.
To support his recovery, Bolton has adopted daily meditation, played golf as much as possible, continued training with a personal coach, and taken vocal lessons, including online voice therapy. The singer expressed that developing resilience and managing problems effectively were key to making the best of a difficult situation and encouraged others to be their own source of motivation.
Bolton also shared that his perspective on life has shifted; he now considers his legacy not just in terms of his music and career but in the life lessons he can pass on to his daughters. He said being present with his family during this time felt right and gave him meaningful moments with them.
Although glioblastoma has a high likelihood of recurrence, Bolton completed his radiation and chemotherapy treatments by October 2024 and continues to undergo MRI scans every two months. His most recent scan in early April showed no signs of cancer returning.
He remains optimistic, saying he still has “a lot to do” in his fight against the disease and even joked about a song title, “Ain’t Going Down Without a Fight.”
